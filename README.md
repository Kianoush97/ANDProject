The DASHTIS is a barbershop located in Horsens, they would like to have an app in which their customers can login and book time for a hair/beard cut, the customer should also be able to cancel the appointment they have reserved for their hair/beard cut. They also think it would be nice if they also could sell their products through this app.
The idea is to deliver an app to The DASHTIS in which the customers can either book or cancel an appointment. Extra functionalities can be added in the future.
